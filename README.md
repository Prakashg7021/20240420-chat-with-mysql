Chinook Database for MySQL: [Chinook_MySql.sql](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/releases/download/v1.4.5/Chinook_MySql.sql)

A MySQL (or SQLite) database using Python and LangChain. We will use the LangChain wrapper of sqlalchemy to interact with the database. We will also use the langchain package to create a custom chain that will allow us to chat with the database using natural language.

As you can see in the diagram above, we will first create a SQL chain that will generate SQL queries based on the userâ€™s input. We will then create a LangChain chain that will allow us to chat with the database using natural language. We will use the langchain package to create both chains.
